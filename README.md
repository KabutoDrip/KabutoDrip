Hi, This is a user manual for anyone that has the pleasure of working with me

My Style: 
I like to get started on my work as early as possible because I know I get distracted easily.
I always prioritize my team work over my individual work and expect my teamates to do the same.
I lay out a plan and do my best to make sure eveyone knows what their job is.

Feel free to approach me anytime for genuine questions, or to spark an interesting or funny conversation, but NEVER wake me up for any reason or you will immediately become my enemy, only I hate myself enough to wake myself up.

Here are my values:
Freedom + Agency: I genuinely believe that our freedoms and choices are the entire purpose of life, its the fundmental difference between God and Satans plan and is what makes everyone unique.
Creativity, Boldness, Diversity + Uniqueness: If I can predict your entire personality within an hour of meeting you, odds are I wont particularly like you.
Humility + Confidence: a weird combination, but someone who is confident in their decisions but can take constructive crticism nd modify or change their plans while remaining confident is a skill I admire.

I like communicating with people through email, text-messages, or communication platforms like Discord, Slack, etc. If you try to reach me through social media, I wont respond because I dont use social media anymore

I make my decisions after contemplating almost every possible outcome of said decision, this can cause some anxiety with decision-making which usually prolongs my decision making skills.

People can help me in a few ways, what I appreciate most is punctuality and communication, get your work done early and communicate any roblems you have If you procrastinate and then ask for help, odds are I already did your work for you. If you cant work on your assignment until later it is crucial you tell me that so i dont end up doing your work. Communication is also important because I micromanage many aspects of my life, If you throw something on my plate on the last second, odds are i wont help. 

I dont tolerate piggybacking off others work, If you consistently dont do your work, I will make sure you dont get credit. I also dont tolerate late work when it comes to programming, often your work is a pre-req for someone elses work, and you being a lazy bum is forcing them to wait for you. This is why you prioritize team work over individual work, because you are only hurting yourself with late individual work.

I understand life is tough, but procrastinating, and not communicating shifts burdens to other people, who also have lives, please be mindfull of your peers. If you need help, just ask, and do it as soon as possible.
